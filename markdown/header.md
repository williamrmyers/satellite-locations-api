This is an example API I've written to pull the location data of orbiting satellites. The data is from the [UCS Satellite Database](https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database#.W4jFBH4naiA).

I intend to use the data to build a Satellite tracking App.

The code is [located here](https://github.com/williamrmyers/satellite-locations-api).
